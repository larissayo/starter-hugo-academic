title: Fire Severity in Reburns Depends on Vegetation Type in Arizona and New
  Mexico, U.S.A.
abstract: After more than a century of low fire activity in the western United
  States, wildfires are now becoming more common. Reburns, which are areas
  burned in two or more fires, are also increasing. How fires interact over time
  is of interest ecologically as well as for management. Wildfires may act as
  fuel treatments, reducing subsequent fire severity, or they may increase
  subsequent fire severity by leaving high fuel loads behind. Our goal was to
  assess whether previous wildfire severity influenced subsequent fire severity
  across vegetation types and over time in the Southwest U.S. using remotely
  sensed fire severity data in 2275 fires that burned between 1984 and 2019.
  Points that reburned tended to be those that burned with lower severity
  initially. Shrublands burned predominantly at moderate to high severity in
  initial fires and in reburns. Pinyon-juniper-oak systems burned with mixed
  severity, and fire severity was consistent from fire to fire. In ponderosa
  pine and aspen-mixed conifer, fire severity tended to decrease with each fire.
  Initial and subsequent fire severity was lower in points that reburned after a
  short interval. These remotely sensed observations of reburn severity need
  verification through field work to understand specific effects caused by
  reburns in different ecosystems. However, in ponderosa pine and aspen-mixed
  conifer forests, it may be beneficial to consider wildfires as fuel treatments
  and work to maintain the fuel reduction effects they have on forested
  ecosystems.

summary: Patterns of reburn severity varied by vegetation type, with ponderosa
  pine-dominated and aspen mixed conifer ecosystems experiencing lower fire
  severity in reburns and shrublands and pinyon-juniper-oak ecosystems more
  likely to burn at the same severity in subsequent fires.
