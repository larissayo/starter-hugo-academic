abstract: Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) stands have historically
  been referred to as “firebreak” forest types that can reduce fire activity,
  but high-intensity and high-severity fires have been observed to burn through
  aspen stands. Clearly, fire activity in aspen is highly variable, which may be
  due to the wide variation in aspen stand composition and structure and because
  the species occurs across wide geographic, environmental, and climatic
  gradients. In the western U.S., there is growing interest in promoting aspen
  stands within wildland-urban interface communities to reduce fire risk, but
  studies that refer to the low flammability of aspen stands rely on limited
  citations. If promoting aspen to reduce fire risk is a desirable forest
  management practice, consolidating the available literature is necessary to
  understand when, where, and how management might achieve this goal. Here, we
  synthesized literature and conducted a survey of forest and fire managers to
  assess current understanding of how fire interacts with aspen stands, as well
  as to examine possible factors that influence fire occurrence, behavior, and
  severity in aspen communities. We found evidence that the presence of aspen
  reduces fire occurrence, fire behavior, and fire severity, but this effect is
  dependent on many factors, including the percentage of aspen vs conifers in
  the overstory, load and type of understory fuels, weather, and season. We did
  not find any quantitative management guidelines on how to create, maintain, or
  use aspen stands to reduce fire risk. The large gap between “common knowledge”
  and empirical evidence regarding aspen’s ability to inhibit fire requires
  further research.

summary: >-
  • High variability in aspen stands makes fire activity in aspen difficult to
  predict.

  • Pure stands with herbaceous understories are more likely to reduce fire behavior.

  • Aspen can burn easily and intensely in windy, dry, or certain seasonal conditions.

  • Specific management guidelines for aspen fire risk reduction treatments are needed.
