title: Comparing Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 for Burn Severity Mapping in Western
  North America
abstract: Accurate assessment of burn severity is a critical need for an
  improved understanding of fire behavior and ecology and effective post-fire
  management. Although NASA Landsat satellites have a long history of use for
  remotely sensed mapping of burn severity, the recently launched (2015 and
  2017) European Space Agency Sentinel-2 satellite constellation offers
  increased temporal and spatial resolution with global coverage, combined with
  free data access. Evaluations of burn severity derived from Landsat and
  Sentinel generally show comparable results, but these studies only assessed a
  small number of fires with limited field data. We used 912 ground calibration
  plots from 26 fires that burned between 2016 and 2019 in western North America
  to compare Sentinel- and Landsat-derived burn severity estimates with the
  field-based composite burn index. We mapped burn severity using two methods;
  the well-established paired scene approach, in which a single pre- and
  post-fire scene are selected for each fire, and also a mean image compositing
  approach that automatically integrates multiple scenes using the cloud-based
  remote sensing platform Google Earth Engine. We found that Sentinel generally
  performed as well or better than Landsat for four spectral indices of burn
  severity, particularly when using atmospherically corrected Sentinel imagery.
  Additionally, we tested the effects of mapping burn severity at Sentinel’s
  finer spatial resolution (10 m) on estimates of the spatial complexity of
  stand-replacing fire, resulting in a 5% average reduction per-fire in area
  mapped as high-severity patch interiors (24,273 ha total) compared to mapping
  at the resolution of Landsat (30 m). These findings suggest Sentinel may
  improve ecological discrimination of fine-scale fire effects, but also warrant
  caution when comparing estimates of burn severity spatial patterns derived at
  different resolutions. Overall, these results indicate that burn severity
  mapping will benefit substantially from the integration of Sentinel imagery
  through increased imagery availability, and that Sentinel’s higher spatial
  resolution improves opportunities for examining finer-scale fire effects
  across ecosystems.

summary: The Sentinel-2 constellation of Earth-observing satellites provides
  similar or even improved estimates of burn severity compared to Landsat 8,
  further validating its use for mapping fire effects across a diversity of
  forested ecosystems.
