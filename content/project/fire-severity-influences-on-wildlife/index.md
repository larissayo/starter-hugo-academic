In collaboration with movement ecologist [Tal Avgar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4o0rUEoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and graduate student [Megan Whetzel](/authors/megan-whetzel), we are working on a project to assess wildlife space use and foraging behavior in fire footprints in Utah. We are using GPS collar data and camera traps to investigate the influence of fire severity on elk behavior and habitat use.
