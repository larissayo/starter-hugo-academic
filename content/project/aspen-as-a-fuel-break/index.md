It is well known that aspen functions as a fuel break in wildland fire situations, but it is difficult to find quantitative guidelines for managing aspen with fuel risk reduction as an objective. Former graduate student [Kristin Nesbit](/authors/kristin-nesbit) led a project to survey fire and forest managers about their observations of fire in aspen and published [a literature review](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2022.120752) about aspen-fire relationships. She also collected fuel loading and fuel moisture data across gradients of aspen-conifer dominance and stages of stand development to further our understanding of the factors leading to flammability of aspen. We are also working on spatial analysis of fire severity across a range of aspen forests.
