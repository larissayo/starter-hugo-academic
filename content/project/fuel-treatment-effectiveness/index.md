summary: Fuel treatments such as prescribed fire and mechanical treatments are
  tools used widely by land managers to meet objectives such as reduction of
  fire area burned, reduction of fire behavior variables such as flame length
  and rate of spread, and reduction of fire severity. Understanding where and
  when these treatments are effective in meeting land management objectives is
  useful for prioritizing future work.

**Fuel treatment effectiveness in Utah.** Fuel treatments such as prescribed fire and mechanical treatments are tools used widely by land managers to meet objectives such as reduction of fire area burned, reduction of fire behavior variables such as flame length and rate of spread, and reduction of fire severity. In the face of a warming climate and increasing fire severity, land management agencies are allocating significant resources to this area. Former graduate student Jamela Thompson led a project using broad-scale spatial analysis to assess the effectiveness of fuel treatments in meeting land management objectives in Utah.

**Using fuel treatments to reduce watershed degradation.** Fire can affect aquatic resources as well as terrestrial landscapes. Colleagues in the Watershed Sciences department and I published [a paper](https://doi.org/10.1029/2018EF001006) documenting the risk that reservoirs are under due to fire risk, given a century of fire exclusion and a historical misunderstanding of fire’s role and prevalence on western landscapes. W﻿e are now working on a project focused on how to place fuel treatments in order to reduce high-severity fire and subsequent negative impacts on downstream reservoir storage and fish habitat through sedimentation and debris flows. Graduate student [Kipling Klimas](/authors/kipling-klimas) is leading this project. 

**Aspen as a fuel break.** It is well known that aspen functions as a fuel break in wildland fire situations, but it is difficult to find quantitative guidelines for managing aspen with fuel risk reduction as an objective. Former graduate student Kristin Nesbit led a project to survey fire and forest managers about their observations of fire in aspen and published [a literature review](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2022.120752) about aspen-fire relationships. She also collected fuel loading and fuel moisture data across gradients of aspen-conifer dominance and stages of stand development to further our understanding of the factors leading to flammability of aspen.
