P﻿hD student [Alex Howe](/authors/alex-howe) is working on a series of projects to better understand drivers and trends in burn severity. Assessment of burn severity across the footprint of a fire is a critical need for both natural resource managers to plan effective restoration treatments, and for researchers who seek to better understand fire behavior and ecology. His [first chapter](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14205249), comparing Landsat and Sentinel satellites for their use in burn severity calculations, was published in Remote Sensing.
