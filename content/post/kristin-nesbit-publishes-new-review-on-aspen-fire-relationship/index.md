### Highlights

* High variability in aspen stands makes fire activity in aspen difficult to predict.
* Pure stands with herbaceous understories are more likely to reduce fire behavior.
* Aspen can burn easily and intensely in windy, dry, or certain seasonal conditions.
* Specific management guidelines for aspen fire risk reduction treatments are needed.
