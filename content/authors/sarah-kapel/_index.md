Sarah graduated in 2017 from the University of Nevada, Reno with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Environmental Science, with an emphasis in Botany. She later worked with the Great Basin Institute and the US Forest Service in the Spring Mountains area of Southern Nevada. There she worked with restoring endemic pollinator habitat including the endangered Mt. Charleston Blue Butterfly. She started at USU as a MS student in January 2022. Her research focused on planting nursery-grown aspen seedlings in post-fire regeneration. She was co-advised by Karen Mock and successfully defended her thesis in December 2023.
