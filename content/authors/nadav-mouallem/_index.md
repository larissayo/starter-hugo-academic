Nadav is a 2016 graduate of Reed College, where he majored in Environmental Studies – Biology and wrote his senior thesis on characteristics that favor the establishment of nonnative species that arrived in ship ballast in Portland, OR. Before returning to graduate school, he worked as an Ecologist for the Institute for Applied Ecology in Corvallis, OR, and also had the opportunity to work for The Nature Conservancy and The New York Botanical Garden. He started at USU in January 2022, and his research focused on forest regeneration after reburn wildfires (fires that have burned over areas that have previously been burned). He successfully defended his thesis in early spring 2024.
